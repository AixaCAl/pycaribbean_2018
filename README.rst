PyCaribbean 2018
===================================================

There are two directories in this repo, since I did a workshop and a presentation.

``intro_to_programming``: Python & Spreadsheets: An Introduction to Programming
-----------------------------

-  ``{integer}_filename.py``: the code files, numbered in the order you should run them.
	-  Example: ``1_loading.py``
	-  Note: files 2 and 3 do THE SAME THING. They're just different ways to do it (for loop vs list comprehension)
-  ``intro_to_programming.xlsx``: the source spreadsheet
-  ``done_pycaribbean.xlsx``: final spreadsheet, created by the code above
-  ``aggregate_time.json``: JSON file created by ``7_create_json_object.py``
-  ``pycaribbean_2018.ipynb``: the Jupyter notebook used in the demo

``sefb``: Software Engineering For Beginners
-------------------------------------------------

-  Slides in Keynote format: ``pycaribbean_2018_sefb.key``
-  Slides in PDF format: ``pycaribbean_2018_sefb.pdf``
